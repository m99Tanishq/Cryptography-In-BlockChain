# Cryptography-In-BlockChain

Data encryption is an important practice used to protect data transfer on the internet. This helps prevent data sent on the internet from unauthorized access.

One of the major algorithms used for data protection on the internet is the Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA algorithm), named after the inventors of this encryption and decryption algorithm.

RSA is a public key algorithm widely used for secure data transmission. This is one of the major cyber security methods of data protection.

In a Blockchain we have the concept of Private And Public Key Where Public Key is Visible And Used For Verification And Private Key Is Hidden And Used To Generate Signature And To Intiate A Transcation

And In This We Will See A Demo How A Crypto Graphy Is Used In BlockChain

Here Is A Demo Version Of It In Python
